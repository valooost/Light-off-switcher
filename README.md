# Light-off-switcher
Tired that your mom wakes you up with this brutal switching-the-light-on? My Idea came from [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNcZpjLA3yI) (2:47), when a guy presented this. I don't know who this is, but he's a hero.

Well, because I am a foolish at IoT, I'll try (as first step) to let the light switch off with an input from a Supersonic Sensor.
Wish me luck!
