# Light-off-switcher
Tired that your mom wakes you up with this brutal switching-the-light-on? My Idea came from [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNcZpjLA3yI) (2:47), when a guy presented this. I don't know who this is, but he's a hero.
You may need:
* Arduino Unor R3 Board
* Prototype Shield (v.5)
* Supersonic Sensor HC-SR04
* MicroServo SG90
* A lot of cables and patience

Well, because I am a foolish at IoT, I'll try (as first step) to let the light switch off with an input from a Supersonic Sensor.
Wish me luck!

After a small breakfast (i got up late) I finished my first code, and connnected the Supersonic Sensor.
